      "Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. Â I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. Â I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. Â If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. Â Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. Â This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. Â It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. Â Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. Â My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. Â That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. Â Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. Â Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. Â The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. Â I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. Â There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. Â While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. Â Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. Â It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. Â This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? Â Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? Â The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. Â I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. Â I wanted Â the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. Â Was it a compliment to the bison? Â It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. Â The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. Â We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. Â The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. Â It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. Â Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. Â This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\n",

      "Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday. Cold night but toasty warm inside. Greeted right away by super friendly staff. Started the night with great cocktails, War of the Roses and Smoke Barrel. Both drinks were beautifully crafty and super delicious. Started with the Venison tartare super fresh, complex, well prepared and extremely tasty and the duck hearts yakitori , two skewers of 3 hearts, each with green onion, beautiful sauces, another must have. For mains we had the venison and the duck. Both dishes were beautifully prepared, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Definitely in the top of best dishes ever had. The wine list is small but is a well thoughtout selection of local , US, French and Italian. For Â dinner we had a wonderful light but complex Grenache, Syrah from France with the duck and and a lush, full California Cab from the central valley with the venison. Ended the night with the sticky toffee desert and Antler coffee. An amazing end to a great dinner. We loved this place, service was great, super nice staff, nice ambience and over the top great food. All dishes were beautifully complex, extremely well prepared. The chef's care and attention to detail is evident in every meal. So many layers of flavour and tastes, too many to capture in this review.Lets just say you need experience it for yourself. Â To quote \"We will be back\"!!\n",

      "WHAT TO TRY?!The foie gras and the venison. Both were my favourite that night. I also enjoyed the scallops too. Other dishes worth trying are the duck heart and the bison rib steak which were nice too. The foie gras was a big piece. It was nicely scored and seared to perfection. Great to pair with the piece of toast and rhubarb compote. Venison was cooked nicely too with the spices and marination on the exterior. Cooked to a medium rare, the spices added to the deliciousness and juices of the venison. Scallops were refreshing and tasty. Added on top with some caviar, it was a mouthful of seafood delight. Not too salty or sweet, a good appetizer to start the meal. Duck heart skewers were yummy too. Grilled very nicely, the duck hearts weren't dry or overly chewy. It got a good bounce to the texture and excited the palate to ask for more. Bison rib steak was cooked to a medium rare as well and the wild mushrooms added to the flavor of the steak bringing out more texture to the whole experience. LAST TIP?!Make reservations! As this restaurant is not too big and is really popular, you'll want to book ahead to avoid disappointment!\n",

      "Antler is a small and charming restaurant focusing on game meat. Service is very friendly and attentive. My glass is always filled, the table is cleaned between dishes. Food comes in a good pace. Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautÃ©ed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautÃ©ed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce. I like the tender duck breast, some part is little chewy but overall is well made dish. The cherry sauce remind me of the Chinese roasted duck plum sauce which is not to my liking.The menu change regularly and I will definitely go back and I really want to try the pasta next time.\n",

      "What an amazing experience Antler provided to Andrea and I.I'll preface quickly; I heard about Antler via the Joe Rogan experience and was immediately interested in dining here. The thought that chef hunts, forages, and cuts his own meats before even cooking them spoke to me. How much more organic can one eat? Andrea and I were seated right away, greeted by a friendly waitstaff, they did an amazing job on checking in periodically.The meals were out-of-this-world, burrata salad was so clean in flavor, arugula was not overwhelmingly spicy, juicy tomatoes, creamy burrata with a perfect chew. First time I ever had tartare, and it was here. The meat was so tasty, and topped with what seemed to be some asparagus and pomegranate. My Ontario duck breast had a wonderful flavor, unlike any meat I've ever had. The skin was seared nicely, the meat was medium but not tough to cut through and the flavor was indescribable; natural and authentic come to mind. The charred dandelions and couscous accompanied the meal perfectly, and allowed one not too feel too gluttonous!Dessert was an espresso martini and a strawberry semi freddo. The cocktail was delicious, sweet, caffeinated (garnished with coffee beans) and just enough kick to remind you there's liquor in there. Semi freddo had some frozen strawberry skins mixed with fresh strawberries, refreshing and light after such a delicious meal. Chef Michael Hunter put this meal in the cross hairs and executed.

      "Solid.From the moment you walk in until you leave. A solid experience.Okay, sure this place has had some protesters. Fine. Go right ahead but I have to say after eating here and the experience. It was fantastic. The food was delicious and customer service was spot on.There were places open but not at all as busy as this place happened to be and I can see why.I started with a cherry tequila mule. Damn tasty, my friends. Highly recommend. Sweet but not overly. I know some people may argue but that burger I had was the best I had in the city. I've tried almost all the ones in town and this, this I still crave. The Game Burger is meat heaven nestled between the perfect buns. I never knew that the combination of game meat could taste so heavenly.. Cooked medium rare created this juicy, flavourful but messy dinner. The herbed fries were the perfect accompaniment. Definitely, satisfying.I only wish I had room for dessert. I spent the latter part of the evening admiring the sweets people had at their tables. It looked visually intoxicating the smoke and cloche action. I'll save that for another trip. Something I look forward to and no doubt will be as good as everything I've had thus far.\n",

      "Bravo! 5 stars food, 5 stars ingredients, 5 stars cooking. Â  Â Antler is about animal protein, be it meat, poultry or seafood. Â My venison was deliciously seasoned, but never overwhelmed the natural beautiful flavors. Â The sauce was mesmerizing; I spent much time decoding the recipe. Â The bison rib eyes was generous in portion. Â The vegetable on the side tasted so good that I couldn't believe it came from a kitchen known for meat. Â This kitchen is so skilled that it could cook anything in my eyes.I loved my meal. Â I left thinking the owner/chef believes in serving honest food cooked in the most simple, yet elegant ways. Â If the honest ingredients turn out to be venison, bison, chicken or cured meat, so be it. Â P.S. if someone from Antler can give me the recipe of the sauce that goes with the venison, my boyfriend will be grateful. (Just kidding, but you can't blame me for trying).\n",

      "This was a great experience. The staff is impeccably trained in service. They were effortlessly adorable and attentive to us as we entered, sat, and ate our meal. Truly, they should celebrate how wonderful the staff is. The food was good! I could kill someone to eat the scallop crudo again. It was seriously delicious. Â I would say that the entrees were not as exciting as the appetizers. Â I had the bison rib eye and my husband the bison short rib pasta. Pasta was far better. However, the cooking on the rib eye was incredible. The sides were amazing, too. I felt the greens outshined the protein, which is probably because it's such a lean meat. The temperature was perfect. Â The short rib pasta did not lack at all. The flavor were awesome. Pasta fresh. Short ribs were yummy. The dessert menu and choice we made were.. okay. I felt the chai ice cream overpowered any other flavor. I did not taste bacon.I'd 100% go back. Great atmosphere and experience. Â And the mushrooms\n",

      "Antler offers delicious and unique food that can't be found anywhere else. It's 100% worth its hype. However I find it a bit expensive for its portion and quality and it's not the highest value restaurant I've been to so -0.5 star on that. Overall it's a good experience and I would recommend this place. Venison tartare: super delicious and fresh tasting meat with great toppings that tastes well with the meat Wild mushroom tarte tatin: this dish smells so good! And it tastes as good as it smells. A range of wild mushrooms baked on a hot and crispy tart with a delicious pesto sauce on top. It's such a special dish. Bruce county Ontario venison: super fresh and delicious meat paired with a slightly sweet parsnip purÃ©e. It's simply delicious. Ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu: the most mediocre dish we had that night. It's not bad but compared to other special dishes this is just a pasta. It's also a bit salty. Maple Brioche ice cream sandwich: the ginger ice cream and caramel were both super delicious by themselves and tastes magic together. The sandwich could be a bit crispier but it's not bad either. The pinch of salt is a nice touch but some prices were to big and too salty at some bites.\n",

      "Came here for a birthday dinner and had an amazing meal. Â The service and the food were on point! Â Scallop crudo - deeeelicious! Â Comes in a scallop shell and salmon roe on top. Duck heart skewers - so tender and flavorful! Â We wound up getting a second order for my 5-yr old, who couldn't get enough. Foie gras - definitely decadent and oh-so-tasty! Â The crispy bread was a nice contrast to the smooth foie, while the fruit compote cut the heaviness nicely. Bison ribeye - cooked perfectly to order, just the right amount of gamey flavor and awesome fat/lean ratio. Came with a generous portion of sautÃ©ed greens (and mushrooms) - enough to make me feel like I was eating a \"relatively\" healthy meal.Hot rabbit - hubby loved this! Â I tried a little and wouldn't say it was my favorite Â - but nothIng against this dish, just not my cup of tea. Duck - my mom ordered this and didn't enjoy the smoky flavor from the char, which I guess was lucky for us Â because everyone else at the table LOVED it! Â So good!We will definitely be back the next time we're in town!\n",

      "Went for brunch with a few friends. The restaurant itself was in a great area and quite cozy. I find that brunch tends to taste relatively the same wherever I go, however I had the duck breakfast sandwich (as well as the eggs Benedict with pork) and the sandwich was one of the best breakfast foods I've tried in Toronto. Highly recommend, and although its a bit small, you can order a side of home fries for an affordable price. The only reason I'm not giving my experience 5 stars is because the food took about an hour to come out and the restaurant was not busy enough to warrant that. Our server was wonderful and very sweet, however so I can't complain about the service beyond the wait times!\n",
