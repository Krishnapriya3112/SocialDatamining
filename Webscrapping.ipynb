Service is very friendly and attentive. My glass is always filled, the table is cleaned between dishes. Food comes in a good pace. Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices.

      "[{'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. \\xa0I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. \\xa0I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. \\xa0If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. \\xa0Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. \\xa0This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. \\xa0It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. \\xa0Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. \\xa0My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. \\xa0That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. \\xa0Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. \\xa0Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. \\xa0The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. \\xa0I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. \\xa0There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. \\xa0While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. \\xa0Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. \\xa0It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. \\xa0This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? \\xa0Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? \\xa0The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. \\xa0I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. \\xa0I wanted \\xa0the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. \\xa0Was it a compliment to the bison? \\xa0It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. \\xa0The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. \\xa0We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. \\xa0The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. \\xa0It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. \\xa0Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. \\xa0This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk0RtzI_RwAj5tcgZbVVew/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday.

The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night.

Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce.

Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce. I like the tender duck breast, some part is little chewy but overall is well made dish. The cherry sauce remind me of the Chinese roasted duck plum sauce which is not to my liking.The menu change regularly and I will definitely go back and I really want to try the pasta next time.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bagM9ODevwSjs7Ti2iIZCw/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Best restaurant in Toronto with a lot of exotic meat options that will blow your mind (and taste buds).

Andrea and I were seated right away, greeted by a friendly waitstaff, they did an amazing job on checking in periodically.The meals were out-of-this-world, burrata salad was so clean in flavor, arugula was not overwhelmingly spicy, juicy tomatoes, creamy burrata with a perfect chew. First time I ever had tartare, and it was here. The meat was so tasty, and topped with what seemed to be some asparagus and pomegranate. My Ontario duck breast had a wonderful flavor, unlike any meat I've ever had. The skin was seared nicely, the meat was medium but not tough to cut through and the flavor was indescribable; natural and authentic come to mind. The charred dandelions and couscous accompanied the meal perfectly, and allowed one not too feel too gluttonous!Dessert was an espresso martini and a strawberry semi freddo. The cocktail was delicious, sweet, caffeinated (garnished with coffee beans) and just enough kick to remind you there's liquor in there.

      "[{'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. \\xa0I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. \\xa0I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. \\xa0If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. \\xa0Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. \\xa0This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. \\xa0It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. \\xa0Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. \\xa0My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. \\xa0That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. \\xa0Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. \\xa0Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. \\xa0The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. \\xa0I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. \\xa0There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. \\xa0While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. \\xa0Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. \\xa0It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. \\xa0This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? \\xa0Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? \\xa0The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. \\xa0I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. \\xa0I wanted \\xa0the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. \\xa0Was it a compliment to the bison? \\xa0It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. \\xa0The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. \\xa0We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. \\xa0The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. \\xa0It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. \\xa0Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. \\xa0This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk0RtzI_RwAj5tcgZbVVew/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday. Cold night but toasty warm inside. Greeted right away by super friendly staff. Started the night with great cocktails, War of the Roses and Smoke Barrel. Both drinks were beautifully crafty and super delicious. Started with the Venison tartare super fresh, complex, well prepared and extremely tasty and the duck hearts yakitori , two skewers of 3 hearts, each with green onion, beautiful sauces, another must have. For mains we had the venison and the duck. Both dishes were beautifully prepared, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Definitely in the top of best dishes ever had. The wine list is small but is a well thoughtout selection of local , US, French and Italian. For \\xa0dinner we had a wonderful light but complex Grenache, Syrah from France with the duck and and a lush, full California Cab from the central valley with the venison. Ended the night with the sticky toffee desert and Antler coffee. An amazing end to a great dinner. We loved this place, service was great, super nice staff, nice ambience and over the top great food. All dishes were beautifully complex, extremely well prepared. The chef\\'s care and attention to detail is evident in every meal.

Both were my favourite that night. I also enjoyed the scallops too. Other dishes worth trying are the duck heart and the bison rib steak which were nice too. The foie gras was a big piece. It was nicely scored and seared to perfection. Great to pair with the piece of toast and rhubarb compote. Venison was cooked nicely too with the spices and marination on the exterior. Cooked to a medium rare, the spices added to the deliciousness and juices of the venison. Scallops were refreshing and tasty. Added on top with some caviar, it was a mouthful of seafood delight. Not too salty or sweet, a good appetizer to start the meal. Duck heart skewers were yummy too. Grilled very nicely, the duck hearts weren't dry or overly chewy. It got a good bounce to the texture and excited the palate to ask for more. Bison rib steak was cooked to a medium rare as well and the wild mushrooms added to the flavor of the steak bringing out more texture to the whole experience. LAST TIP?!Make reservations!

      "[{'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. \\xa0I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. \\xa0I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. \\xa0If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. \\xa0Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. \\xa0This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. \\xa0It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. \\xa0Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. \\xa0My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. \\xa0That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. \\xa0Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. \\xa0Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. \\xa0The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. \\xa0I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. \\xa0There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. \\xa0While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. \\xa0Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. \\xa0It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. \\xa0This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? \\xa0Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? \\xa0The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. \\xa0I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. \\xa0I wanted \\xa0the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. \\xa0Was it a compliment to the bison? \\xa0It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. \\xa0The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. \\xa0We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. \\xa0The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. \\xa0It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. \\xa0Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. \\xa0This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk0RtzI_RwAj5tcgZbVVew/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday. Cold night but toasty warm inside. Greeted right away by super friendly staff. Started the night with great cocktails, War of the Roses and Smoke Barrel. Both drinks were beautifully crafty and super delicious. Started with the Venison tartare super fresh, complex, well prepared and extremely tasty and the duck hearts yakitori , two skewers of 3 hearts, each with green onion, beautiful sauces, another must have. For mains we had the venison and the duck. Both dishes were beautifully prepared, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Definitely in the top of best dishes ever had. The wine list is small but is a well thoughtout selection of local , US, French and Italian. For \\xa0dinner we had a wonderful light but complex Grenache, Syrah from France with the duck and and a lush, full California Cab from the central valley with the venison. Ended the night with the sticky toffee desert and Antler coffee. An amazing end to a great dinner. We loved this place, service was great, super nice staff, nice ambience and over the top great food.

Both were my favourite that night. I also enjoyed the scallops too. Other dishes worth trying are the duck heart and the bison rib steak which were nice too. The foie gras was a big piece. It was nicely scored and seared to perfection. Great to pair with the piece of toast and rhubarb compote. Venison was cooked nicely too with the spices and marination on the exterior. Cooked to a medium rare, the spices added to the deliciousness and juices of the venison. Scallops were refreshing and tasty. Added on top with some caviar, it was a mouthful of seafood delight. Not too salty or sweet, a good appetizer to start the meal. Duck heart skewers were yummy too. Grilled very nicely, the duck hearts weren't dry or overly chewy. It got a good bounce to the texture and excited the palate to ask for more. Bison rib steak was cooked to a medium rare as well and the wild mushrooms added to the flavor of the steak bringing out more texture to the whole experience. LAST TIP?!Make reservations! As this restaurant is not too big and is really popular, you'll want to book ahead to avoid disappointment!\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S1tvX-tVrJ3hNAQNxWAheA/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"Antler is a small and charming restaurant focusing on game meat. Service is very friendly and attentive. My glass is always filled, the table is cleaned between dishes. Food comes in a good pace. Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce. I like the tender duck breast, some part is little chewy but overall is well made dish. The cherry sauce remind me of the Chinese roasted duck plum sauce which is not to my liking.The menu change regularly and I will definitely go back and I really want to try the pasta next time.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bagM9ODevwSjs7Ti2iIZCw/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Best restaurant in Toronto with a lot of exotic meat options that will blow your mind (and taste buds).

The thought that chef hunts, forages, and cuts his own meats before even cooking them spoke to me. How much more organic can one eat? Andrea and I were seated right away, greeted by a friendly waitstaff, they did an amazing job on checking in periodically.The meals were out-of-this-world, burrata salad was so clean in flavor, arugula was not overwhelmingly spicy, juicy tomatoes, creamy burrata with a perfect chew. First time I ever had tartare, and it was here. The meat was so tasty, and topped with what seemed to be some asparagus and pomegranate. My Ontario duck breast had a wonderful flavor, unlike any meat I've ever had. The skin was seared nicely, the meat was medium but not tough to cut through and the flavor was indescribable; natural and authentic come to mind. The charred dandelions and couscous accompanied the meal perfectly, and allowed one not too feel too gluttonous!Dessert was an espresso martini and a strawberry semi freddo. The cocktail was delicious, sweet, caffeinated (garnished with coffee beans) and just enough kick to remind you there's liquor in there. Semi freddo had some frozen strawberry skins mixed with fresh strawberries, refreshing and light after such a delicious meal. Chef Michael Hunter put this meal in the cross hairs and executed.

Some smoked duck breast, chicken liver, ham terrine, and beef tongue, served with the most delicious sweet pickled little onion. Delicious! I actually really enjoyed this (even though it wasn't what I expected). I recommend it if you're feeling adventurous!CHEESE BOARD: Loved the cheese at Antler. We didn't get a chance to choose which cheese we got - instead, our server (who was phenomenal) asked us a few questions about our preferences and brought these two out. Both were DELICIOUS and paired well with the charcuterie platter.SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE: This one was not a favourite. \\xa0The presentation was very cool - it came out in a glass dome filled with smoke, and they lifted the dome at the table so the smoke dispersed into the air. \\xa0I found that the dessert was TOO smoky, which ruined the flavour a bit.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WvXBkOYNwrtUKi2rSzJ-vg/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Looks like a perfect place for intimate dinner, turned out that their breakfast was great too.I had the Eggs Benedict which was amazing.

I've tried almost all the ones in town and this, this I still crave. The Game Burger is meat heaven nestled between the perfect buns. I never knew that the combination of game meat could taste so heavenly.. Cooked medium rare created this juicy, flavourful but messy dinner. The herbed fries were the perfect accompaniment. Definitely, satisfying.I only wish I had room for dessert. I spent the latter part of the evening admiring the sweets people had at their tables.

      "[{'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. \\xa0I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. \\xa0I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. \\xa0If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. \\xa0Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. \\xa0This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. \\xa0It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. \\xa0Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. \\xa0My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. \\xa0That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. \\xa0Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. \\xa0Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. \\xa0The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. \\xa0I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. \\xa0There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. \\xa0While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. \\xa0Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. \\xa0It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. \\xa0This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? \\xa0Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? \\xa0The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. \\xa0I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. \\xa0I wanted \\xa0the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. \\xa0Was it a compliment to the bison? \\xa0It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. \\xa0The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. \\xa0We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. \\xa0The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. \\xa0It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. \\xa0Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. \\xa0This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk0RtzI_RwAj5tcgZbVVew/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday. Cold night but toasty warm inside. Greeted right away by super friendly staff. Started the night with great cocktails, War of the Roses and Smoke Barrel. Both drinks were beautifully crafty and super delicious. Started with the Venison tartare super fresh, complex, well prepared and extremely tasty and the duck hearts yakitori , two skewers of 3 hearts, each with green onion, beautiful sauces, another must have. For mains we had the venison and the duck. Both dishes were beautifully prepared, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Definitely in the top of best dishes ever had. The wine list is small but is a well thoughtout selection of local , US, French and Italian. For \\xa0dinner we had a wonderful light but complex Grenache, Syrah from France with the duck and and a lush, full California Cab from the central valley with the venison. Ended the night with the sticky toffee desert and Antler coffee. An amazing end to a great dinner. We loved this place, service was great, super nice staff, nice ambience and over the top great food. All dishes were beautifully complex, extremely well prepared. The chef\\'s care and attention to detail is evident in every meal.

Both were my favourite that night. I also enjoyed the scallops too. Other dishes worth trying are the duck heart and the bison rib steak which were nice too. The foie gras was a big piece. It was nicely scored and seared to perfection. Great to pair with the piece of toast and rhubarb compote. Venison was cooked nicely too with the spices and marination on the exterior. Cooked to a medium rare, the spices added to the deliciousness and juices of the venison. Scallops were refreshing and tasty. Added on top with some caviar, it was a mouthful of seafood delight. Not too salty or sweet, a good appetizer to start the meal. Duck heart skewers were yummy too. Grilled very nicely, the duck hearts weren't dry or overly chewy. It got a good bounce to the texture and excited the palate to ask for more. Bison rib steak was cooked to a medium rare as well and the wild mushrooms added to the flavor of the steak bringing out more texture to the whole experience. LAST TIP?!Make reservations! As this restaurant is not too big and is really popular, you'll want to book ahead to avoid disappointment!\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S1tvX-tVrJ3hNAQNxWAheA/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"Antler is a small and charming restaurant focusing on game meat. Service is very friendly and attentive. My glass is always filled, the table is cleaned between dishes. Food comes in a good pace. Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce. I like the tender duck breast, some part is little chewy but overall is well made dish. The cherry sauce remind me of the Chinese roasted duck plum sauce which is not to my liking.The menu change regularly and I will definitely go back and I really want to try the pasta next time.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bagM9ODevwSjs7Ti2iIZCw/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Best restaurant in Toronto with a lot of exotic meat options that will blow your mind (and taste buds).

      "[{'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Antler is located on the north side of Dundas between Dufferin and Gladstone.Antler to me definitely has a couple things going for them. \\xa0I think first it's a great place to have meat dishes that revolve around game meat of the wild variety and because of that it's probably where I consider some pretty well themed Canadian type dishes. \\xa0I say that because yes in Canada we have bison and venison but those aren't your everyday type fare for most. \\xa0If you go to a place to purchase meat besides Whitehouse in St Lawrence Market, bison and venison are not commonly consumed. \\xa0Just that alone puts this place apart from your everyday beef, pork, chicken and fish type menus.Just because wild game is primarily the menu doesn't mean there isn't fish as well or dishes that don't involve meat like a mushroom risotto as well. \\xa0This place still has options that aren't only meat although it's more than obvious that the wild game meat is their thing.That being said yes, I went all out on this meal because it's hardly ever that I have the opportunity to have this type of fare. \\xa0It was my brother's birthday and he selected the restaurant. \\xa0Because we were a party of seven and everybody ordered something different we had a very wide variety of dishes to sample between us.My nephew went with the burger and fries which sounds pretty standard but the patty is a boar/bison/venison mix. \\xa0My wife had the wild mushroom risotto, my mom had the boar ragout while my sister had some sort of pasta I wasn't sure of while my brother went with the venison and I went with the bison steak.For starters my brother got the venison patty which is essentially a Jamaican type patty stuffed with venison meat instead of beef. \\xa0That didn't really impress me as much as I ordered the venison tartare for sharing. \\xa0Tartare while I generally enjoy it is really something you have to like. \\xa0Sure it's raw but it's prepared properly just like sashimi. \\xa0The serving seemed generous in a sense that it came with a sufficient amount of crostini and the serving itself was great for being able to cover the top of each piece of bread sufficiently and evenly generous. \\xa0I had ordered it with the normal serving of sturgeon caviar on top. \\xa0There's options for larger portions of the caviar (1/2 or full ounce) but that wasn't necessary. \\xa0While caviar will always add a hint of salty accent to a dish it helps but doesn't take over. \\xa0Venison for as gamey as it may be seems to be more subdued when it's served as a tartare.The bison steak was thick and not as bloody as I was expecting considering it was supposed to be medium rare. \\xa0It was served on top of a bed of rapini with a swipe of polenta which isn't really a replacement for a starch filler. \\xa0This cut was so generous the starch is not the star of the dish right? \\xa0Well it comes topped with mushrooms as well but an add in was the foie gras for I think 24 bucks? \\xa0The piece of foie gras is rich, about maybe 2 by 3 inches in size, half an inch thick. \\xa0I only had a tiny portion of it as I really shouldn't be eating it and shared the rest. \\xa0I wanted \\xa0the taste of it but didn't need to necessarily have it. \\xa0Was it a compliment to the bison? \\xa0It wasn't necessary but it wasn't gratuitous either. \\xa0The bison cut is the type of main I think if you're coming here you are almost obligated to try.My wife had asked for the Cedar sorbet as dessert. \\xa0We were going back to our place for cake after this so everybody didn't order dessert but we shared this sorbet which is refreshing. \\xa0The easiest way to explain this thing is it's like somebody went up north and got virgin snow, made a snowball and crushed it in a bowl and then added some berries. \\xa0It's definitely a cool dish and a nice compliment to having just consumed all sorts of richness just beforehand.Overall I thought the service was great. \\xa0Our server really looked after us for my brother's dinner and the food was very good too. \\xa0This place is a step away from the everyday in almost every way so it's a really different and refreshing change for something fancy with a good overall experience.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk0RtzI_RwAj5tcgZbVVew/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Dinner at Antler for my spouses birthday. Cold night but toasty warm inside. Greeted right away by super friendly staff. Started the night with great cocktails, War of the Roses and Smoke Barrel. Both drinks were beautifully crafty and super delicious. Started with the Venison tartare super fresh, complex, well prepared and extremely tasty and the duck hearts yakitori , two skewers of 3 hearts, each with green onion, beautiful sauces, another must have. For mains we had the venison and the duck. Both dishes were beautifully prepared, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Definitely in the top of best dishes ever had. The wine list is small but is a well thoughtout selection of local , US, French and Italian. For \\xa0dinner we had a wonderful light but complex Grenache, Syrah from France with the duck and and a lush, full California Cab from the central valley with the venison. Ended the night with the sticky toffee desert and Antler coffee. An amazing end to a great dinner. We loved this place, service was great, super nice staff, nice ambience and over the top great food. All dishes were beautifully complex, extremely well prepared. The chef\\'s care and attention to detail is evident in every meal. So many layers of flavour and tastes, too many to capture in this review.Lets just say you need experience it for yourself. \\xa0To quote \"We will be back\"!!', 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3YaxZ5XMiKEtyYkGlchtsg/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"Note this is a Covid curb side patio review. Stopped by for a drink on the weekend and they seem to be doing everything right. Hand sanitizer spray is available for anyone wanting to use the temporary patio they have set up on the street. We just had fries and drinks, but there is a limited menu available, with one vegetarian option (in addition to the fries). The website shows a veg risotto but I don't recall seeing that on the printed version when I was there.\"}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"WHAT TO TRY?!The foie gras and the venison. Both were my favourite that night. I also enjoyed the scallops too. Other dishes worth trying are the duck heart and the bison rib steak which were nice too. The foie gras was a big piece. It was nicely scored and seared to perfection. Great to pair with the piece of toast and rhubarb compote. Venison was cooked nicely too with the spices and marination on the exterior. Cooked to a medium rare, the spices added to the deliciousness and juices of the venison. Scallops were refreshing and tasty. Added on top with some caviar, it was a mouthful of seafood delight. Not too salty or sweet, a good appetizer to start the meal. Duck heart skewers were yummy too. Grilled very nicely, the duck hearts weren't dry or overly chewy. It got a good bounce to the texture and excited the palate to ask for more. Bison rib steak was cooked to a medium rare as well and the wild mushrooms added to the flavor of the steak bringing out more texture to the whole experience. LAST TIP?!Make reservations! As this restaurant is not too big and is really popular, you'll want to book ahead to avoid disappointment!\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S1tvX-tVrJ3hNAQNxWAheA/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '4', 'Comments': \"Antler is a small and charming restaurant focusing on game meat. Service is very friendly and attentive. My glass is always filled, the table is cleaned between dishes. Food comes in a good pace. Two of us shared one appetizer and two entrees and we are stuffed at the end. Venison Tartare - the dish is very appealing; picked wild mushroom, buckthorn berries and few pieces of mint on top of tartare. The aioli is light and not overly salted so all the ingredients are well balanced with each other. Tartare is fresh and have a nice texture. We enjoy this dish very much. Bison Rib Eye - medium rare, dry aged, 10oz rib eye with foraged mushroom, sautéed kales, (very) creamy polenta in red wine jus is definitely a highlight of the night. It is perfectly cooked and is so tender. The meat doesn't have much seasoning, but perfectly pair with the sautéed kales with spices. Must order item!!Pan Roasted Ontario Duck - wild liquorice marinated duck breast with charred dandelion and onion on bed of quinoa. Served with red wine and cherry sauce. I like the tender duck breast, some part is little chewy but overall is well made dish. The cherry sauce remind me of the Chinese roasted duck plum sauce which is not to my liking.The menu change regularly and I will definitely go back and I really want to try the pasta next time.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bagM9ODevwSjs7Ti2iIZCw/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': 'Best restaurant in Toronto with a lot of exotic meat options that will blow your mind (and taste buds).

The chips that go with the dish are so good we ordered extra!* Arctic char - it's a special feature of the night. The skin is crispy, and the fish is just a bit rare on the inside. Goes so well with the wild mushroom and rice* Bison rib eye with foie gras - The steak is dry aged and the fat retained so much flavor! Foie gras added to the richness of the dish!

To start, I ordered the pâté along with the bread. \\xa0The paté was a little bland but thankfully that was forgotten once the amazing main course arrived. I had a hard time deciding what to order and wish I could have ordered a tasting of everything! I landed on the venison and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My sister doesn't eat meat so ordered the risotto. This is a tough restaurant with minimal options for vegetarians but the risotto was creamy and very well done. We finished with a chocolate mousse and meringue which was smooth and rich without being too sweet. The biggest downside for me is their seating. Even with reservations, we were placed at the bar. When you are splurging on a nice evening out, bar seating just doesn't live up to expectations.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JFM_LxTBKdHYRWKGAz7-3g/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"What an amazing experience Antler provided to Andrea and I.I'll preface quickly; I heard about Antler via the Joe Rogan experience and was immediately interested in dining here. The thought that chef hunts, forages, and cuts his own meats before even cooking them spoke to me. How much more organic can one eat? Andrea and I were seated right away, greeted by a friendly waitstaff, they did an amazing job on checking in periodically.The meals were out-of-this-world, burrata salad was so clean in flavor, arugula was not overwhelmingly spicy, juicy tomatoes, creamy burrata with a perfect chew. First time I ever had tartare, and it was here. The meat was so tasty, and topped with what seemed to be some asparagus and pomegranate. My Ontario duck breast had a wonderful flavor, unlike any meat I've ever had. The skin was seared nicely, the meat was medium but not tough to cut through and the flavor was indescribable; natural and authentic come to mind. The charred dandelions and couscous accompanied the meal perfectly, and allowed one not too feel too gluttonous!Dessert was an espresso martini and a strawberry semi freddo. The cocktail was delicious, sweet, caffeinated (garnished with coffee beans) and just enough kick to remind you there's liquor in there. Semi freddo had some frozen strawberry skins mixed with fresh strawberries, refreshing and light after such a delicious meal. Chef Michael Hunter put this meal in the cross hairs and executed.

Some smoked duck breast, chicken liver, ham terrine, and beef tongue, served with the most delicious sweet pickled little onion. Delicious! I actually really enjoyed this (even though it wasn't what I expected). I recommend it if you're feeling adventurous!CHEESE BOARD: Loved the cheese at Antler. We didn't get a chance to choose which cheese we got - instead, our server (who was phenomenal) asked us a few questions about our preferences and brought these two out. Both were DELICIOUS and paired well with the charcuterie platter.SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE: This one was not a favourite. \\xa0The presentation was very cool - it came out in a glass dome filled with smoke, and they lifted the dome at the table so the smoke dispersed into the air. \\xa0I found that the dessert was TOO smoky, which ruined the flavour a bit.\", 'image': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WvXBkOYNwrtUKi2rSzJ-vg/348s.jpg'}, {'Rating': '5', 'Comments': \"Looks like a perfect place for intimate dinner, turned out that their breakfast was great too.I had the Eggs Benedict which was amazing.

Damn tasty, my friends. Highly recommend. Sweet but not overly. I know some people may argue but that burger I had was the best I had in the city. I've tried almost all the ones in town and this, this I still crave. The Game Burger is meat heaven nestled between the perfect buns. I never knew that the combination of game meat could taste so heavenly.. Cooked medium rare created this juicy, flavourful but messy dinner. The herbed fries were the perfect accompaniment. Definitely, satisfying.I only wish I had room for dessert. I spent the latter part of the evening admiring the sweets people had at their tables.

Bruce county Ontario venison: super fresh and delicious meat paired with a slightly sweet parsnip purée. It's simply delicious. Ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu: the most mediocre dish we had that night. It's not bad but compared to other special dishes this is just a pasta. It's also a bit salty. Maple Brioche ice cream sandwich: the ginger ice cream and caramel were both super delicious by themselves and tastes magic together. The sandwich could be a bit crispier but it's not bad either.
